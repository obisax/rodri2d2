## Hi! I'm Rodri! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodri2d2/rodri2d2/master/hi%20.jpeg)



*Since 2012 I have been studding software development.
After finish my first Technical Certificate, I started work as Android and IOS developer.
This little job as mobile developer tooks me to something different. Since than, I had worked in other projects and companies that help me improve some skills not only on software development, but also in another computers domains such as Networking, Linux and why not say it: MS Excel, which I don't master it yet but is a great tool to work with.
But now, I am going back to my roots, mobile software development. Of course I'm not closed to different views. However let get focus on Mobile.*
